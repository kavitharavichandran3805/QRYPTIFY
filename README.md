# QRYPTIFY

Cryptographic Algorithms Identification

This project focuses on automatically identifying cryptographic algorithms used in files, data streams, or communication channels. The system leverages techniques from pattern recognition, statistical analysis, and machine learning to detect and classify commonly used cryptographic algorithms.

✨ Key Features

Detects and classifies popular cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, DES, RSA, ECC, MD5, SHA).

Supports both symmetric and asymmetric encryption as well as hashing algorithms.

Uses statistical fingerprints and entropy-based analysis to recognize cryptographic patterns.

Machine learning integration for improved accuracy and adaptability.

Lightweight and extensible design for easy integration into larger systems.

🎯 Use Cases

Security auditing and vulnerability assessment.

Malware and forensic analysis.

Reverse engineering encrypted files and traffic.

Academic and research applications in cryptography.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: Vite + React (interactive UI & visualization)

Backend: Django REST Framework (API endpoints & authentication)

Machine Learning: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.)
